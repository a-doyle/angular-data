# angular-registration
 A registration system built using AngularJS and Google Firebase.
 
 Google Firebase is a backend service that provides data storage, authenticaton and static website hosting for this Angular app.
 
 This application makes use of the AngularFire complement by binding the Angular code to the Firebase service.
 
 This application has a secure authentication form, providing users access to meeting checkins, awards display and other functionality.
 
 The application uses a Firebase database created specifically for it, so access is limited to the localhost.
 
 Any feedback is more than welcome, and I plan to expand upon this feature application in creating future Angular projects.
